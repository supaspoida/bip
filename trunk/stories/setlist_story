Story: Working with setlist data

  As a user
  I want to create setlists
  So that I can document the show
  
  Scenario: Create a new setlist
  
    Given a new setlist for 'appearance'
    And a number of existing setlists
    
    When I save the setlist
    
    Then the setlist should be valid
    And there should be 1 more setlist stored
    
  Scenario: Adding a song
    
    Given a setlist with no performances
    And a song 'Above the Waves'
    
    When I add the song
    
    Then the performance should be valid
    And there should be one more performance
    And the performance position should be 1
    And the performance should be tagged with set I
    
  Scenario: Adding another song
  
    Given a setlist with 1 performance
    And a song 'Down to the Bottom'
    
    When I add the song
    
    Then the performance should be valid
    And there should be one more performance
    And the performance position should be 2
    
  Scenario: Changing to set II
  
    Given a setlist with 5 performances
    And a song 'Shem Rah Boo'
    
    When I start set II with 'Shem Rah Boo'
    
    Then the performance should be valid
    And the performance should be tagged with set II
